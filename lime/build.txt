To build the Lime utility:

## Linux:

  Make sure you have zlib development libraries installed for your environment.

  Navigate to /lime/ and type `make`.

  Release binary should appear in /lime/bin/.

## Windows:

  Navigate to \windows\vs16 and use Visual Studio 16 to open the solution file.
  Select the configuration you want to use (for example Release / x64) and build
  the Lime project.

  Binary should appear in \lime\bin\[x86|x64]\[Debug|Release].

Produced binary is a standalone executable that you can copy into your own projects.
